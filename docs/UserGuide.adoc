== Introduction

Study Buddy is a desktop application which is designed for students who *wish to manage their module related tasks*.
More importantly, Study Buddy is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

You will never have to remember long, wordy commands to use your command line interface, since
Study Buddy *provides an interactive way of communication*, which not only helps to prevent typos, but also makes the application much easier to use!

If you can type fast, Study Buddy can get your module management done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Currently, Study Buddy support both Windows and Mac systems. If you are interested, please jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started.

Hope you enjoy!

== Quick Start

. Study Buddy relies on a particular computer environment to operate correctly,
thus to enjoy it, you need to have `Java 11` or above installed in your computer.
- Here is the guideline for checking java version of your computer.

== Features
=== Basic features
==== Help :
This function displays a list of interactive commands that you can use.
It also provides a link to this document, (our user guide).

[TIP]
This is the command you should use if you are unsure of what to type for a certain command,

*Example:*

Say you have forgotten the format of a command and need some help.

Study Buddy provides a help command for your convenience!

To `help`:

. Initiate the command using keyword `help`

This command is for you to record a new task into Study Buddy.

- Through the interaction, task's details will be collected.
.. Required information: task name, task type, task deadline or duration
.. Optional information: module, task description, task weight, estimated number of hours needed
.. Input format requirement:
+
[cols="1,2,1", options="header"]
|===

 `HH:mm dd/MM/yyyy-HH:mm dd/MM/yyyy` +

`HH -> hour, mm -> minutes, dd -> date, mm -> month,
yyyy -> year`

Say you want to view a list of all your pending tasks.

Study Buddy provides an option to filter your list!

To `filter`:

. Initiate the command using keyword `filter`

==== Exit
This command exits from Study Buddy.

[NOTE]

In response to yes, the application should simply close.

[NOTE]
Any command other than `yes` (including kbd:[enter]) will be considered as a quit from the exit.

=== Saving Data

Study Buddy data is automatically saved in the hard disk after any command that changes the data.

There is no need to save manually.

When the application is closed and re-opened, you should be able to see all the data you have added previously!

=== Due Soon Tasks

The due soon task list is always on display in your application under `Study Buddy` -> `All tasks`

It provides the following functionality:

. It displays your tasks that are due within the next week. (uses deadline you have provided)
+
image::duesoon/duesoon1.png[width="790", align= "left", title="Due Soon List"]

. It automatically sorts these tasks in an ascending order of deadlines.

. It provides a <<Refresh>> function that allows you to refresh time/state of this list if needed.

[NOTE]
Time left is never displayed in days and minutes. Hence if the current time is 9:00 am on 01/04/2020 and the task deadline is 9:02 am on 02/04/2020, it will show time left as 1 day. (not 1 day and 2 minutes)

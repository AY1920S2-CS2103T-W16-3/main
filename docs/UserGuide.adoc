== Introduction

Study Buddy is a desktop application which is designed for students who *wish to manege their module related tasks*.
More importantly, Study Buddy is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

You will never have to remember long, wordy commands to use your command line interface, since
Study Buddy *provides an interactive way of communication*, which not only helps to prevent typos, but also makes the application much easier to use!

If you can type fast, Study Buddy can get your module management done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Currently, Study Buddy support both Windows and Mac systems. If you are interested, please jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started.

Hope you enjoy : )

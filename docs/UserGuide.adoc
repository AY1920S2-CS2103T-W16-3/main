== Introduction

. StudyBuddy is an application designed for students. It makes keeping track of all *module related tasks* extremely convenient.
. The application even provides functions such as visual aids, timers etc to enhance the user experience.
. StudyBuddy is also *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, Study Buddy can get your module management done faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Introduction

Study Buddy is a desktop application which is designed for students who *wish to manage their module related tasks*.
More importantly, Study Buddy is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

You will never have to remember long, wordy commands to use your command line interface, since
Study Buddy *provides an interactive way of communication*, which not only helps to prevent typos, but also makes the application much easier to use!

If you can type fast, Study Buddy can get your module management done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Currently, Study Buddy support both Windows and Mac systems. If you are interested, please jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started.

Hope you enjoy!
//end::introduction[]

//updated by Souwmyaa
//tag::addDuplicates[]
==== Add duplicates
This command accounts for you adding duplicate tasks. When you attempt to add a duplicate, the name will be modified slightly so that you can differentiate them.

*Example:*

Say you have tried to add a task, you enter all the fields needed and at the end, you realise that you have already added this task.

Study Buddy lets you add duplicate tasks with a slight modification! So, now you can add the task and edit it as needed.

[NOTE]
A task is considered duplicate when the name, type, module, description, weightage, estimated time cost and deadline are the same. (Status is not checked)

To `add duplicates`:

. Follow the same steps as in <<Add>>, but enter a duplicate task.
. Study Buddy should respond with:
+
image::addDuplicate.png[width="600", title="Reponse to adding a duplicate"]
+
. Type in `yes` if you would like to continue and `no` if you do not.
. If you type `yes` and press kbd:[enter]
. The Study Buddy should respond with:
+
image::addDuplicate1.png[width="600", title="Response to adding duplicate"]
+
. As you can see in the snippet above, Study Buddy will append a number in brackets to the task name. This number corresponds to the number of times this task name has been duplicated.
+
[NOTE]
If you add two duplicates of a task (eg: task(1) and task(2)), and then delete task(1), when u try to duplicate it again, it will get added as task(3). The number will not reset to 2, because this is the third time you are attempting to duplicate.

.  If you choose to enter `no` at step 2, this is what you will see.
+
image::addDuplicate2.png[width="600", title="Response to choosing not to add"]

[TIP]

To indicate the task you want to edit, you need to provide its index number.

*Example:*

When you want to update some details of a task or there are some typo in an existing
task. You can use this command to edit as you wish.

====
*Constrains*

. Each new value and index number entered will be checked under the same constrain of add command.
. When editing weight or module, the application will also make sure the total weight of related module's tasks will not overflow (i.e. exceed 100).
. You cannot edit a task to be a duplicate. i.e all the fields cannot be the same as a task that already exists.

****
* To `unarchive` a task, and add it back to the main list, simply follow the same set of commands, but replace the `archive` keyword with `unarchive`
* Remember to use the index in the *Archived Task* instead of *All Tasks*
****

[NOTE]

. It provides a <<Refresh>> function that allows you to refresh time/state of this list if needed.

[NOTE]
Time left is never displayed in days and minutes. Hence if the current time is 9:00 am on 01/04/2020 and the task deadline is 9:02 am on 02/04/2020, it will show time left as 1 day. (not 1 day and 2 minutes)

== PROJECT: Study Buddy

---

== Overview

StudyBuddy is a desktop application which is designed for students who *wish to manage their module related tasks*.
It is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) but still contains some aspects of Graphical User Interface (GUI) which was written using JavaFX.
The codebase is in Java and contains about 13kLoc.

== Summary of contributions

=== Enhancements

* *Major enhancement*: added *the Due Soon List feature*
** What it does:
. Allows user to view a list of tasks due within the next week in one panel
. Displays time left before the deadline for each due soon task
. Automatically updates when changes are made to the data (additions, deletions, edits etc)
** Justification: This feature is extremely helpful to the user because it helps to remind them of upcoming deadlines
** Highlights:
. This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future since any command that changes data will affect it.
. The implementation was challenging because it required changes to be made to a lot of commands.
. It involved working in the logic, storage and UI components of the code base.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the Refresh Due Soon List command*
** What it does:
. Allows user to refresh due soon task list
. This command will add any tasks that have recently become due soon
. It will also update the time left for each deadline on the due soon tasks
** Justification: This feature is extremely helpful to the user because if they have had the application open for a long time, the time left in due soon tasks and the due soon list itself may need refreshing.
** Highlights:
This enhancement formed the foundation code base for a lot of other features that needed to be refreshed. For example, the refreshing of status tags is also done using this refresh class.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the Delete Task command*
** What it does:
. Allows user to delete an existing task in the list
** Justification: This feature is extremely helpful to the user because it enables them to remove tasks from their list.
** Highlights:
This enhancement was a crucial command and is also used as a supporting command by a lot of other features.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the Filter command*
** What it does:
. Allows user to filter by status (eg: finished, pending etc) or by type (eg: assignment, quiz etc)
** Justification: This feature is extremely helpful to the user because it enables them to filter their list of all tasks by various categories.
** Highlights:
. This enhancement was a crucial command.
. The implementation was tricky because as the number of choices user was given increased, the checks for exceptions etc became more complex.

* *Minor enhancement*: added *the Exit command*
** What it does:
. Allows user to exit the application
. In case user has entered this command by mistake, provides an option to go back.
** Justification: This feature is extremely helpful to the user because it enables them to exit when needed.
** Highlights:
This enhancement was a crucial command.

* *Minor enhancement*: added *the Clear command*
** What it does:
. Allows user to delete all data that has been entered
** Justification: This feature is helpful to the user if they decide to start with a fresh Study Buddy.

* *Minor enhancement*: added *the Delete Duplicate Tasks command*
** What it does:
. Allows user to delete any duplicate tasks in the list
** Justification: This feature is helpful to the user if they decide to remove any duplicate tasks from their list.

* *Minor enhancement*: added *add duplicate tasks option*
** What it does:
. Allows user to add duplicate tasks to their list
. Rather than not allow duplicate tasks, prompts user asking if he/she is sure they want to add a duplicate task.
** Justification:
. This feature is helpful to the user because Study Buddy lets the user decide what they want to do.
. Eventually if needed, user could use the edit/delete duplicates command to amend any mistakes.
** Highlights:
This feature was not easy to implement, because Address Book had a lot of checks to avoid duplication of tasks. These checks needed to be addressed for the feature to work.

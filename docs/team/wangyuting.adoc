== PROJECT: Study Buddy

== Overview

StudyBuddy is a desktop application designed for students who *wish to manage their module related tasks* in a convenient and user-friendly interface. The application is written in Java and spans over 12k lines of code.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: designed *the interactive process logic*
** *Function*:
. It allows user to execute his/her command in an interactive way.
. Display clear instruction or error message at each interaction step.
. When invalid command received (e.g. the user made a typo mistake), the interaction will not
terminate, instead, it will response with clear instruction and wait for user's next action.
. Allow user to quit from interaction using "quit" keyword.
** *Justification*: +
. This feature saves user from remembering long, wordy commands to use the command line interface.
. The "stay and wait" reaction against any invalid input improves the typo-tolerance of the application, which contributes a
notable benefit to CLI users.
** *Highlights*:
. The implementation was challenging because it required a huge changes in the original logic.
. The time left me to design and develop this logic was tight because
I needed to finish it so that my team can started to work on their own part.

* *Major enhancement*: designed *the UI/UX of Study Buddy*
** *Function*:
. The GUI of:
.. Landing page (i.e. the all tasks page)
.. Modules page
.. Statistics page
.. Calendar page
.. The Task card (i.e. the items in task list)
. Responsive layout. The inner components can automatically adjust themselves according to
the current width and height.
. The mouse events when:
.. hovering on menu bar item, calendar button, as well as tabs in modules and statistics page
.. focusing on list items (e.g. all tasks list)
.. clicking on chars in statistics page
** *Justification*:
. The GUI of this application follows a relaxed style,
which helps users to ease the pressure accumulated from school.
. The responsive layout allows the application to be adapted to different screen sizes.
. The mouse event makes it easier for user to focus on what he/she is doing.
** *Highlights*:
+
To design and implement of the UI/UX requires lot of self-learning and reference.

* *Major enhancement*: added *task summary feature*
** *Function*:
. Automatically summarizes the collected data into different charts.
.. *pie chart* compares the number of tasks in different statuses.
.. *area chart* summarizes the task deadlines or start dates for different modules.
.. *stacked bar chart* compares the weight of different types of tasks in each module
. Retrieves and displays relevant tasks when user clicking on a chart.
. Listen to the data change and update simultaneously.
** *Justification*:
. The statistics helps user to integrates scattered information in one place and represents in dynamic charts,
witch makes the information more straightforward.
. With this feature, user can be more productive as they have better idea of what is going on and
what is more important.
. The statistics is auto-generated along the way the user managing their records using keyboard input,
which means this feature can contribute significant value to those fast typist.
** *Highlights*:
. The data bind of each chart is not easy to implement, especially when I take this opportunity to
practice on Lambda.
. It also needs to be careful when choosing a suitable chart for a data set. Even for the same collection of data,
the comparison results obtained from different charts can be variant.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the Add and Edit command*
** *Function*:
+
. Add: Allows user to add a new task in the list.
. Edit: Allows user to edit an existing task in the list.
** *Justification*:
+
This feature is extremely helpful to the user because it enables them to insert and edit task.
** *Highlights*:
+
Implementing this basic functionality is not easy because it involves a lot of obvious and non-obvious validation,
such as:

.. obvious: empty input for required fields, wrong input format etc.
.. non-obvious: the validation of time, task weight etc.


* *Minor enhancement*: added *the Sort command*
** *Function*:
. Allows user to sort their tasks by:
.. Deadline / Task Start Date
.. Task Name
.. Creation Date & Time
** *Justification*:
+
This feature can help uer to prioritize their task by desired aspect.

== PROJECT: Study Buddy

== Overview

StudyBuddy is a desktop application designed for students who *wish to manage their module related tasks* in a convenient and user-friendly interface.
It is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) but still contains some aspects of Graphical User Interface (GUI) which was written using JavaFX.
The codebase is in Java and contains about 13kLoc.

== Summary of contributions

=== Enhancements

* *Major enhancement*: designed *the interactive process logic*
** What it does:
. To
. Loads all due soon tasks (with updated time) into the panel when application is launched.
. Displays time left before the deadline for each due soon task.
. Automatically sorts tasks to be in order of most urgent to least urgent deadline.
. Automatically updates when changes are made to the data (additions, deletions, edits etc).
** Justification: This feature is extremely helpful to the user because it helps to remind them of upcoming deadlines
** Highlights:
. This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future since any command that changes data will affect it.
. The implementation was challenging because it required changes to be made to a lot of commands.
. It involved working in the logic, model, storage and UI components of the code base.
. It also involved changing the GUI.

* *Major enhancement*: added *task summary feature*
** What it does:
. Allows user to refresh due soon task list
. This command will add any tasks that have recently become due soon
. It will also update the time left for each deadline on the due soon tasks
** Justification: This feature is extremely helpful to the user because if they have had the application open for a long time, the time left in due soon tasks and the due soon list itself may need refreshing.
** Highlights:
. This enhancement formed the foundation code base for a lot of other features that needed to be refreshed. For example, the refreshing of status tags is also done using this refresh class.
. It required working in the UI, logic and model components of the code base.

* *Major enhancement*: designed *the UI/UX of Study Buddy*
** What it does:
. Allows user to add duplicate tasks in the list.
. It however automatically appends brackets with a number to the task name of duplicate task.
. The number corresponds to the number of times task has been duplicated.
. Ensures that edit and unarchive command do not cause duplication of tasks either.
** Justification:
. This feature is helpful to the user because the add task command involves adding several fields.
. We can only detect duplicates at the end of task addition command, hence if the user makes a mistake in one field, they will have to re-enter everything if duplicates are not allowed.
. This way, user is given a choice whether or not to add duplicate task and they can go back and edit/delete as they like.
** Highlights:
. This feature was quite difficult to implement because there are several corner cases to take care of.
. It required working on other commands, such as edit command (to stop user from editing a task to be a duplicate) and unarchive command (because user can unarchive a duplicate task).
. Since study buddy already had a lot of tests and checks to prevent duplicate tasks, it required a very large amount of refactoring code.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the add and edit Task command*
** What it does:
. Allows user to delete an existing task in the list
** Justification: This feature is extremely helpful to the user because it enables them to remove tasks from their list.
** Highlights:
. This enhancement was a crucial command and is also used as a supporting command by a lot of other features.
. It involved working in the UI, logic and model components of the code base.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the edit command*
** What it does:
. Allows user to filter by status (eg: finished, pending etc) or by type (eg: assignment, quiz etc)
** Justification: This feature is extremely helpful to the user because it enables them to filter their list of all tasks by various categories.
** Highlights:
. This enhancement was a crucial command.
. The implementation was tricky because as the number of choices user was given increased, the checks for exceptions etc became more complex.
. It involved working in the UI, logic and model components of the code base.

* *Minor enhancement*: added *the sort tasks command*
** What it does:
. Allows user to view all renamed tasks in their list
** Justification:
. This feature is helpful to the user because they might want to see all the tasks that have auto-edited names in one place, so they can go back and edit.

* *Minor enhancement*: added *the Exit command*
** What it does:
. Allows user to exit the application
. In case user has entered this command by mistake, provides an option to go back.
** Justification: This feature is extremely helpful to the user because it enables them to exit when needed.
** Highlights:
This enhancement was a crucial command.

* *Minor enhancement*: added *the Clear command*
** What it does:
. Allows user to delete all data that has been entered
** Justification: This feature is helpful to the user if they decide to start with a fresh Study Buddy.
